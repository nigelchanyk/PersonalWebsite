                    <p>When I was in grade seven, my school held a swimming contest. The four available strokes are freestyle, breaststroke, backstroke, and butterfly stroke. Since I knew all four styles, I applied for all available events. Even though I was pretty good at swimming, I stood no chance the best swimmers in my school, and I lost in the first three events. However, when I attended to the butterfly stroke event, surprisingly, I was the only participant since butterfly stroke was not very popular. So, I took my time and swam across the pool. That is how I got my very first gold medal. How awesome is that?</p>

                    <p>When I was applying for University of Waterloo programs, I decided to take Computer Science because I was (and still am) good at programming and I had not heard of Software Engineering. However, I could not find Computer Science since I did not know which faculty it belonged to. So, I searched through the faculty of Science because "Computer Science" has the word "Science" in it, but Computer Science is in fact in the Math faculty. After that, I randomly searched across different faculties, and I came across Software Engineering. I read the description of the program, and noticed that this is also a program related to programming. So, I told myself, "Meh! Close enough...", and TAH-DAHHH! I am now a candidate for the Bachelor of Applied Science in Software Engineering! Actually, I am very glad that I did not find Computer Science. Otherwise, I would not have taken such awesome program.</p>
